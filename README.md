# DISA STIGs for Windows 11

## What does DISA stand for and who are they?
The **Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)** is a U.S. Department of Defense combat support agency that serves as the military's primary IT and telecommunications provider. Essentially acting as the DoD's "IT department," DISA secures and operates the global command and control networks that enable the President and military leaders to communicate, share critical data, and execute orders anywhere in the world.

## What does STIG stand for and what is it?
A **Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)** is a cybersecurity configuration standard developed by the *Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)* to secure computer hardware and software. Functioning as a technical "how-to" manual, a STIG provides detailed checklists for "hardening" systems—such as disabling unnecessary services, enforcing strict password policies, and restricting network access—to reduce vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. While compliance is mandatory for any device connecting to U.S. Department of Defense networks, STIGs are widely used by other government agencies and private organizations as a gold standard for secure system configuration. In other words, further securing an already secured system.
